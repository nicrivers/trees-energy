This repository includes replication material for:
"Quasi-experimental evidence on the effect of the urban tree canopy on energy consumption"
by Fatemah Ravazdezh and Nicholas Rivers

To approximately replicate all results in the paper:
1. Clone the repository

2. Obtain non-confidential data from the Mendely repository at the following URL:
https://data.mendeley.com/preview/6g72mndtys?a=7eac386e-07ec-49cd-8437-434592e066ea
These data should be added to the "intermediate_data/" folder.

3. Execute the code "code/Master_script"

Note that the Mendeley data is a non-confidential version of the original data. Addresses have been removed and tree canopy data has been rounded to preserve anonymity. Geographic information has been jittered to preserve anonymity.
